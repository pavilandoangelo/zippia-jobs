# zippia-jobs

**_Zippia Test Project_** an application to get the jobs through api call given by zippia. I based the UI to the given site for the design reference. I used [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) A utility-first CSS framework to have control on the html elements. I have added two buttons that will filter by company name and date posted. Lastly, I have added a load more functionality that will basically load more items if possible.
Used starter template of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app).
